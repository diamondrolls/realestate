     <center><div class='border3'><p>Banking is the study of money.It is used to fund and startup everything we use in our day to day lives. Banking and realestate goes hand and hand.
	     JUST LIKE HOW LOANS AND BANKING GO HAND AND HAND. You need good credit to get a good loan and start a good franchise. You need knowledge and 
	     great personnel to effectively run the business. Then you need the technology to keep your business alive.
    There is not one without the other. Our whole system is based off banking a rules that should not be underwritten. I am not going to say 
    all banks do is fund people and institutions, this would be false. Banks practically regulate our economy and the currency that goes through
    each city. They can be a great starting point in to your world full of money. Again you should not underwrite nor be over confident when it comes to either 
    finincial tool. Because money is a tool; nothing more nothing less. </p></div></center>
          
 
<center><div class='border3'><p>For anybody who knows something there is always something 
   more to learn. Please let me enlighten you. This article is going to be talking 
   about the best types of compound interest and how to make your money grow for you. Interested in making some extra cash? Good, I thought so, i am too. 
   Compounding is a very handy money saving and maturity tool that will help you make more money. Compounding is widly talked about because of its leaps you can
   make from rags to riches. In layman's terms, compounding is reinvesting your money you have earned from an investment and instead of spending that money 
   you reinvest it into another money savings tool. Like buying a computer and selling it and then buying more computers with that money and doing the
   process all over again. To get technical you can take your reinvested money and let it compound in the bank for a spiffy pojected outcome. This is 
   called automated compounding because you dont have to do much and your money will reinvest itself. Look up CDs and Money Market Accounts, banking systems 
   have great tools they use to help you. Dont just go off of one persons word do your own research and make sure your fact add up before putting your
   money into any government institution.</p></div></center>

<center><div class='border3'><p> Banking and real-estate is like a work of art, you have to focuse on one part at a time to understand the whole process.</p></div></center>
     

<center><div class='border3'><p> Always be responsible with money you own. There are many aspects of banking but banking revolves around credit and currency. Go out and get a credit card go out and get that 5 million
  dollar car you want, you are worth it and you deserve it. People make these accusations about money and loans that are driving people away from the blessings
  they can be getting or should be getting. There are good aspects about credit and there are bad aspects about credit. Paying off a car loan you defaulted on or had gotten repoed is one
  example of a bad credit. You can make the money you want through credit or but you have to look into your skills and make decisive decisions on teh best options you have around you.
  you have realestate, money, wifi, people, bills and merchandise, etc. but if you want more bang for your buck credit might provide you with the answers you need. Start off with a secured
  credit card and basically compound interest based on a point system. The more credit you have the more you can buy the things you really want to get approved for. Save more for the bigger purchases
  and be sure to build a history of all the payments you are making or have already made. Also having a diversified portfolio is a better way of making the lenders throw money at you.
  You want to build up your proftfolio like its an instagram page, or stock portfolio, diversified and interesting, but never in the negative. There are multiple ways of doing this and
  one of the more simple ways is to apply for many credit cards but spend only the money you would normally spend on groceries or food or a date and make sure you pay it off in full at the
  the end of the month. This will most definately increase your credit score and once you have done this with a few credit cards you should look into having a charge card or a rewards card.
  These cards can pay for free air fair much more. Having diversity in your credit history is good and having a long credit history is also very well. You can find great places like credit karma
  to check your credit and you should always monitor your credit and history. Never close your your credit card because you want to keep your credit history intact and flowing.
  Remember you should alway keep credit in its place and use it responsibly. There are penalties to not paying loans off on time and your credit might go down which in terms would 
  hinder you from getting lower interest rates or making and some business would think you're more of a risk factor. We Are going to assume you are trust worthy. Even if you get 10,000 dollars 
  in credit try to utilize only 5 percent of that which would be 500 dollars, this makes you lokk more responsible and it show poise in your spending cognizence.</p></div></center>
